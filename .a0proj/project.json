  "description": "Cloud-native, multi-tenant salon management SaaS with AI-first architecture. Built on Google Cloud Platform with 25 specialized AI agents, 4 Progressive Web Apps (Owner, Manager, Staff, Client), and event-driven serverless backend using Firestore, Firebase Auth, and Twilio omnichannel communications.",
  "instructions": "## Project Guidelines\n\n### Working Directory\n- Always work inside /a0/usr/projects/salon_flow\n- Do not rename project directory or modify .a0proj meta files\n\n### Architecture\n- **Database**: Firestore (NoSQL document store) with multi-tenant isolation via salon_id\n- **Authentication**: Firebase Auth with custom JWT extension (bcrypt)\n- **Monorepo structure**: apps/ (owner, manager, staff, client PWAs), services/ (api, ai, notification), packages/ (ui, shared)\n- **AI Architecture**: 25 specialized agents with hexagonal/pipeline/microkernel layers\n- **Event-driven**: GCP Pub/Sub for async communication between services\n- **Serverless**: Cloud Run with scale-to-zero for cost efficiency\n\n### Development Workflow\n- Use TDD approach - write tests first\n- Run tests before committing: npm test (frontend) and pytest (backend)\n- Follow existing code patterns and conventions\n- Use specialized agents for complex tasks (see .a0proj/agents/)\n\n### PWA Testing with Playwright CLI (v1.58.2)\n\n#### Test Configurations\n- playwright.config.ts - Default local testing\n- playwright.prod.config.ts - Production URL testing\n- playwright.gcp.config.ts - GCP deployment testing\n- playwright.debug.config.ts - Debug mode with traces\n\n#### Running Tests\n```bash\n# Run all PWA tests locally\nnpx playwright test\n\n# Run specific PWA app tests\nnpx playwright test tests/e2e/owner.spec.ts\nnpx playwright test tests/e2e/staff.spec.ts\nnpx playwright test tests/e2e/manager.spec.ts\nnpx playwright test tests/e2e/client.spec.ts\n\n# Run against production\nnpx playwright test --config=playwright.prod.config.ts\n\n# Run GCP integration tests\nnpx playwright test --config=playwright.gcp.config.ts\n\n# Debug mode with traces\nnpx playwright test --config=playwright.debug.config.ts --trace on\n\n# View test report\nnpx playwright show-report\n```\n\n#### Workflow Pattern: Navigate → Snapshot → Interact → Verify\n1. Navigate to PWA URL\n2. Take snapshot for visual baseline\n3. Interact with elements using locators\n4. Verify expected outcomes\n\n#### Test Results\n- Results stored in test-results/\n- HTML reports in playwright-report/ and playwright-report-gcp/\n- Traces available for debugging failed tests\n\n### Key Integrations\n- **Firestore**: NoSQL database with multi-tenant data isolation\n- **Firebase Auth**: JWT-based authentication with custom token extension\n- **Twilio**: WhatsApp Business API and SMS for omnichannel communications (cost-optimized)\n- **OpenRouter**: LLM gateway for 25 AI agents (Gemini models)\n- **Google Cloud Run**: Serverless deployment with scale-to-zero\n- **Upstash Redis**: Session and AI response caching\n- **Upstash Vector**: Semantic search and RAG capabilities\n- **GCP Pub/Sub**: Event-driven messaging between services\n\n### API Testing\n- Backend tests use pytest in tests/api/\n- AI service tests in tests/ai/\n- Run with: pytest tests/ -v\n\n### Cost Optimization\n- Twilio: Use GSM-7 encoding (no emojis), keep messages under 160 chars, SMS for normal priority\n- AI: Response caching via Upstash Redis reduces LLM calls by 70%\n- Compute: Cloud Run scale-to-zero saves 60% on compute costs",
